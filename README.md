# daddy
_It's usually very difficult for me to name something._

I have a lot of services running in containers on servers and I was previously using 

[nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) for those but lately found that `daddy` is more suited for me.

`daddy` has a wiki, please go [there](https://github.com/minlaxz/daddy/wiki) for more information.
