# daddy
_It's usually challenging for me to name something._

`daddy` is `caddy` in `docker` container; this name is easy for me to remember. ðŸ˜†

`daddy` has a wiki, please go [there](https://github.com/minlaxz/daddy/wiki) for more information.

daddy can

- reverse proxy (other containers or compose services)
- forward proxy (example: running `hysteria2` behind the `daddy`)
